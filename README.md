# Ulam Spiral
The [Ulam spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers, devised by mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam in 1963.

The image on the left shows the pattern in which numbers are spiraled. The image on the right outlines the prime numbers in the spiral.

This program was devised to visualize this spiral to whichever number is specified.

## Primes 

For determining whether an integer is prime, this program uses

[Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) 

for efficiency when computing the primality of larger numbers. I previously used trial division, but learned about Sieve through exploring number theory and algorithms. 

# Results
The interesting nature of the Ulam Spiral is rooted in the striking presence of diagonals that form. 

Below, are the results of spirals generated by the program, showcasing 3 spirals with increasing length that help illustrate the pattern.

Note, that composite numbers are denoted by "#", and primes are denoted by "*"
